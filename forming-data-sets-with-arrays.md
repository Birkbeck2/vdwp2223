The world is full of lists, and so are computer programs.

In JavaScript, lists are called *arrays*. With arrays, you can collect things into larger groups, add things to groups, remove things, and create subgroups. You can also prepare things for iteration, and catch the outputs of iteration--which we will talk about next.

## Array syntax

Arrays are formed with square brackets `[` and `]`.
