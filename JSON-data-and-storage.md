# Visualising data with Javascript

## JSON data and storage

### History of JSON

JSON or JavaScript Object Notation was introduced in the early 2000s as a way of describing and exchanging text-based data.

JSON was initially developed as a way for JavaScript clients and back-end servers to communicate.

Data is useful in many different ways: to more fully describe what is happening in different systems such as nature, weather, business, communication or politics.

It is native to JavaScript but can also be used with other programming languages. Being human readable, it is easy to use, but also incredibly versatile.

Today JSON is the universal standard of data exchange.
